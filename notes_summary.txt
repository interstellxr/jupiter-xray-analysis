Discussion/report:
- error sources: main error source is on measurement (eg. of jupiter count rate ), next main error source is crab flux (not count rate) (SPI paper, 7%), parallax, psf
- talk about psf and pixel offsets and how used for Jupiter data using Crab LCs
- talk about flux conversion
- mention ScW distributions and methodology of querying and parallax correction, ScW selection
- error/noise : annular error and count rates let us see if image in is noisy in general

Data analysis:
- check error of conversion factor smaller than count rate measurement of jupiter error 

- Crab LC queries for JEM-X & 30-60 keV
    - From these, get offsets and save them, to then use on Jupiter data
    - Also get the yearly averages (or monthly) and use for flux conversion
- Finish Jupiter queries (remember for JEM-X you have extra column to check if Jupiter is in FOV, no need to query all ScWs)
- Do all statistics on new data (after having introduced offsets)
- Stacking on new data

- Spectra and upper limits

- One servers are back up, also use parallax correction on already saved table
