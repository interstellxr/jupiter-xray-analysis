WEEK 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Read some literature on X-ray observations of Venus and Jupiter
- Read articles and noted information on INTEGRAL and its instruments
- Started the ODA/API tutorial

Meeting notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)
- we will mostly be interested in images, not light curves (basically many images)
- main idea: find jupiter and science window(s) for certain timescale and stack images keeping Jupiter fixed.

To-do : 
[X] finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query 
[X] look at how to use tokens 
[X] check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
[X] get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
 
WEEK 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished the ODA/API tutorial
- Read more literature and did summaries, found many information on Jupiter's X-rays and time variability
- Used JPL's Horizons module with astroquery to get Jupiter's ephemerides
- Obtained initial ISGRI data (arbitrary times) where Jupiter is present within a certain search radius
- Since I query Jupiter's position from Earth and not INTEGRAL, I looked at the maximum angular error
due to the seperation between INTEGRAL and Earth

Meeting notes:
- 

To-do:
[] use online platform to get ScWs containing Jupiter. Download lists year by year.
