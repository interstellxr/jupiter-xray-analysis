WEEK 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Read some literature on X-ray observations of Venus and Jupiter
- Read articles and noted information on INTEGRAL and its instruments
- Started the ODA/API tutorial

Meeting notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)
- we will mostly be interested in images, not light curves (basically many images)
- main idea: find jupiter and science window(s) for certain timescale and stack images keeping Jupiter fixed.

To-do : 
[X] finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query 
[X] look at how to use tokens 
[X] check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
[X] get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
 
WEEK 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished the ODA/API tutorial
- Read more literature and did summaries, found many information on Jupiter's X-rays and time variability
- Used JPL's Horizons module with astroquery to get Jupiter's ephemerides
- Since I query Jupiter's position from Earth and not INTEGRAL, I looked at the maximum angular error
due to the seperation between INTEGRAL and Earth
- Had some problems with astroquery (specifying time interval does not work). Initially started to use HEASARC online query.
- Obtained initial ISGRI data where Jupiter is present within a certain search radius (found ScW online)
- Finally: I decided to retrieve ScWs corresponding to Jupiter's position on a monthly basis, then filter out the ScWs by 
matching the month of the observation to the monthly position of Jupiter

To-do:
[] Now that I can get ScWs containing Jupiter, I need to analyze them. I have the metadata I need also. I can look at durations, 
and I can also get light curves. But light curves only for the object being observed? To check! 

WEEK 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished code for getting ScWs containing Jupiter over given time period. Ran the code for 2003-2024, took 20 minutes 
and now I have all ScWs with Jupiter in the FOV (using 8 degree search radius).
- Managed to read and image some ScWs from the saved file. Understood the metadata (image, variance, significance, exposure).
- Many (errors?) when querying certain ScWs, for example: "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : analysis exception : inapplicable"
or "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : task dependencies delegated : inapplicable" (not really errors, still works). Many are empty also, could be due to the energy band?

My ideas for what to do next: 
- Study long term variability (solar cycle of ~ 11 years) => stack images month by month maybe?
- Stacking: to stack n images, I need to query the n images and choose a reference image for Jupiter (known coords). 
Need to convert Jupiter's coords to pixel coordinates and apply a transformation on all images except the reference. 
Then stack (average).
- For short-term variability, better to work with light curves for exposures longer than the timescale (~ 45 min).
But for light curves, how do these work? Because they're for the observed object right?
