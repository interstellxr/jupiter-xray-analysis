WEEK 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Read some literature on X-ray observations of Venus and Jupiter
- Read articles and noted information on INTEGRAL and its instruments
- Started the ODA/API tutorial

Meeting notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)
- we will mostly be interested in images, not light curves (basically many images)
- main idea: find jupiter and science window(s) for certain timescale and stack images keeping Jupiter fixed.

To-do : 
[X] finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query 
[X] look at how to use tokens 
[X] check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
[X] get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
 
WEEK 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished the ODA/API tutorial
- Read more literature and did summaries, found many information on Jupiter's X-rays and time variability
- Used JPL's Horizons module with astroquery to get Jupiter's ephemerides
- Since I query Jupiter's position from Earth and not INTEGRAL, I looked at the maximum angular error
due to the seperation between INTEGRAL and Earth
- Had some problems with astroquery (specifying time interval does not work). Initially started to use HEASARC online query.
- Obtained initial ISGRI data where Jupiter is present within a certain search radius (found ScW online)
- Finally: I decided to retrieve ScWs corresponding to Jupiter's position on a monthly basis, then filter out the ScWs by 
matching the month of the observation to the monthly position of Jupiter

To-do:
[X] Now that I can get ScWs containing Jupiter, I need to analyze them. I have the metadata I need also. I can look at durations, 
and I can also get light curves. But light curves only for the object being observed? To check! 

WEEK 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished code for getting ScWs containing Jupiter over given time period. Ran the code for 2003-2024, took 20 minutes 
and now I have all ScWs with Jupiter in the FOV (using 8 degree search radius).
- Managed to read and image some ScWs from the saved file. Understood the metadata (image, variance, significance, exposure).
- Many (errors?) when querying certain ScWs, for example: "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : analysis exception : inapplicable"
or "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : task dependencies delegated : inapplicable" (not really errors, still works). Many are empty also, could be due to the energy band?

My ideas for what to do next: 
- Study long term variability (solar cycle of ~ 11 years) => stack images month by month maybe?
- Stacking: to stack n images, I need to query the n images and choose a reference image for Jupiter (known coords). 
Need to convert Jupiter's coords to pixel coordinates and apply a transformation on all images except the reference. 
Then stack (average).
- For short-term variability, better to work with light curves for exposures longer than the timescale (~ 45 min).
But for light curves, how do these work? Because they're for the observed object right? So not sure about small timescales.
- Use Optical Monitoring Camera to confirm Jupiter's position? Maybe not possible due to small FOV?
- For now looking at IBIS data (high energies > 15 keV). Jupiter's emission is low energy (~< 3 keV). Look at JEM-X data?
- I read today INTEGRAL got deactivated 28/02/2025 :-(

Meeting notes:
- Check variance accuracy through intensity map (std of box around source)
- Extract the countrate + uncertainty at point of source (as function of time)
- Also try to get countrate straight from query by passing source to catalog/query (see examples), will also give image
- Compare the above two
- This countrate is just counts per detector => need to convert to flux (photons/area/time). Then this can be compared to other data.
For the conversion: take observation of source with known flux (crab), make image, extract countrate, learn what is actual flux (in that energy range).
See paper by jordain et al about SPI (1e-8 erg/cm2/s, 20-80 keV range). Take the model, integrate over energy range.
- Do same things for JEM-X
- Significant peak: above ~ 5 sigma (make sure not just statistical noise)

To-do:
[] Obtain variance manually through intensity
[] Compare the calculated and extracted variances
[] Extract countrate and uncertainty at the source as function of time (multiple ScWs)
[] Obtain countrate by passing source to catalog (check examples)
[] Compare the two countrates
[X] Convert countrate to flux using crab nebula
[] Once you figure out all that, do the same for JEM-X
