WEEK 1
Notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)

To-do : 
- finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query
- look at how to use tokens
- get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
- check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
