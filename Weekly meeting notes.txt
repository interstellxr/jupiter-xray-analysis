WEEK 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Read some literature on X-ray observations of Venus and Jupiter
- Read articles and noted information on INTEGRAL and its instruments
- Started the ODA/API tutorial

Meeting notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)
- we will mostly be interested in images, not light curves (basically many images)
- main idea: find jupiter and science window(s) for certain timescale and stack images keeping Jupiter fixed.

To-do : 
[X] finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query 
[X] look at how to use tokens 
[X] check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
[X] get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
 
WEEK 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished the ODA/API tutorial
- Read more literature and did summaries, found many information on Jupiter's X-rays and time variability
- Used JPL's Horizons module with astroquery to get Jupiter's ephemerides
- Since I query Jupiter's position from Earth and not INTEGRAL, I looked at the maximum angular error
due to the seperation between INTEGRAL and Earth
- Had some problems with astroquery (specifying time interval does not work). Initially started to use HEASARC online query.
- Obtained initial ISGRI data where Jupiter is present within a certain search radius (found ScW online)
- Finally: I decided to retrieve ScWs corresponding to Jupiter's position on a monthly basis, then filter out the ScWs by 
matching the month of the observation to the monthly position of Jupiter

To-do:
[X] Now that I can get ScWs containing Jupiter, I need to analyze them. I have the metadata I need also. I can look at durations, 
and I can also get light curves. But light curves only for the object being observed? To check! 

WEEK 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did:
- Finished code for getting ScWs containing Jupiter over given time period. Ran the code for 2003-2024, took 20 minutes 
and now I have all ScWs with Jupiter in the FOV (using 8 degree search radius).
- Managed to read and image some ScWs from the saved file. Understood the metadata (image, variance, significance, exposure).
- Many (errors?) when querying certain ScWs, for example: "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : analysis exception : inapplicable"
or "... mosaic_ii_skyimage : task dependencies delegated : inapplicable" (not really errors, still works). Many are empty also, could be due to the energy band?

My ideas for what to do next: 
- Study long term variability (solar cycle of ~ 11 years) => stack images month by month maybe?
- Stacking: to stack n images, I need to query the n images and choose a reference image for Jupiter (known coords). 
Need to convert Jupiter's coords to pixel coordinates and apply a transformation on all images except the reference. 
Then stack (average).
- For short-term variability, better to work with light curves for exposures longer than the timescale (~ 45 min).
But for light curves, how do these work? Because they're for the observed object right? So not sure about small timescales.
- Use Optical Monitoring Camera to confirm Jupiter's position? Maybe not possible due to small FOV?
- For now looking at IBIS data (high energies > 15 keV). Jupiter's emission is low energy (~< 3 keV). Look at JEM-X data?
- I read today INTEGRAL got deactivated 28/02/2025 :-(

Meeting notes:
- Check variance accuracy through intensity map (std of box around source)
- Extract the countrate + uncertainty at point of source (as function of time)
- Also try to get countrate straight from query by passing source to catalog/query (see examples), will also give image
- Compare the above two
- This countrate is just counts per detector => need to convert to flux (photons/area/time). Then this can be compared to other data.
For the conversion: take observation of source with known flux (crab), make image, extract countrate, learn what is actual flux (in that energy range).
See paper by jordain et al about SPI (1e-8 erg/cm2/s, 20-80 keV range). Take the model, integrate over energy range.
- Do same things for JEM-X
- Significant peak: above ~ 5 sigma (make sure not just statistical noise)

To-do:
[X] Convert countrate to flux using crab nebula (CrabAnalysis.ipynb)
[X] Obtain variance manually through intensity (ScWAnalysis.ipynb)
[X] Compare the calculated and extracted variances (ScWAnalysis.ipynb)
[X] Obtain countrate by passing source to catalog (JupiterLC.ipynb)
[] Extract countrate and uncertainty at the source over multiple ScWs (ScWscombined.ipynb)
[] Once you figure out all that, do the same for JEM-X

WEEK 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This week's notes:
- Had some problems as we discussed via email
- Fixed: crab ScW selection (ends with 0), hardcode catalog for Jupiter
- Not fixed: obtaining images for multiple ScWs using asynchronous querying (returning blank images),
WCS problem (too low countrate for the crab, but conversion code is correct)
- Obtained light curves: next steps: get other light curves for other ScWs and see if the behavior is similar,
for a given scw, get lightcurves on random points for comparison (I know this is something done for exoplanet transits)

Meeting notes:
- long term LCs from isgri_lc and from extracting directly from images
- when bright sources in fov, add jupiter to outputted catalog 
- for better collaborating use github issues / add as developer
- do same for crab nebula to compare (test your method)
- get Jupiter's seperation from pointing direction (all ScWs) over time
- instrument response changes over time (over integral's telescope). Use conversion factor
(using crab as standard calibrator which is mostly constant). Compute every year or a bit less 
and use it to offset instrument response. For short term, bkgd is subtracted.
- for crab radial offset: should show observations are twice a year 
(no observations when close or opposite sun)
- only use OSA11.2 (remove condition)

To-do:
[X] Obtained Crab ScWs and plotted monthly distribution
[] Get longterm LCs using both isgri_lc (passing to catalog) and images 
    [] Crab
    [] Jupiter
[] For the crab, get the countrate twice each year for flux conversion
[] Plot Jupiter's angular offset (distance between Jupiter and pointing direction) over time

WEEK 4+5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My notes:
- Crab analysis
    -> Need to write a code to asynchronously query light curves (time bins = ScW durations) and images for
    one ScW per month every year. ScWs on the Crab are present for ~ 6 months per year over 22 years so
    this gives ~ 120 ScWs to query.
    -> Once finished, this gives the long term light curve of the crab for both methods
    -> Compare the two methods and make sure they are consistent with each other
    -> Study the variability and use the values for yearl or bi-yearly flux conversion (averaging)
    -> Also get a few short term light curves
- Jupiter analysis
    -> Long term light curves using same method as the Crab
    -> Plot angular offset over time
    -> More short term lightcurves

Problems encountered:
- DispatcherException => due to problems server-side? Resolved within a day, but appeared again briefly.
- AnalysisException => main standing problem
    -> one problem at least is when taking the ~ 5 first ScWs and ~ 10 last ScWs of a revolution. 
    This is when the telescope crosses radiation belts.
    -> another is that the good_isgri condition doesnt work in astroquery. Need to do it after like for the times.

- I have updated my ScW selection to choose good_isgri as being > 1000. This leads to not as many ScWs (~ 800 for Jupiter).
- I also added code for taking PPPP > 0005 (not the first 5). Not sure how to do for not the last 10 as max PPPP varies.
- Need to replicate what I have done for the Crab on Jupiter + run light curve method & compare
- Need to fix ScW selection (added ra and dec values, same ones for multiple ScWs)
- I'll disable the emails

Meeting notes:
- can fit psf using gaussian but only amplitude
- also for jupiter but with smeared gaussian (sum of many gaussians)
- for variance from images, also take variance around the pixel (annular or other) and plot

- for PPPP upper bound, look at max PPPP for each revolution so do per revolution
- first try psf fitting and compare to pixel fitting with crab before moving to jupiter
- stacking: map to new grid
    - average? best to do weighted average (by error), rate divided by variance etc (see variance weighted mean)
    - not possible to get an actual mean flux 
    - monthly first could be good

- parallax error is actually significant when considering PSF!! sub-pixel resolution!
    - to take into account: get INTEGRAL's position: https://www.astro.unige.ch/mmoda/dispatch-data/gw/scsystem/api/v1.0/sc/2024-03-15T20:10:44/0/0
    - astropy to convert Jupiter coordinates on Earth to the coordinates from the satellite

Process for getting precise Jupiter position:
- first, dont change how you are getting the ScWs. You get monthly positions with 8deg search radius.
- then, from the obtained ScWs, get the precise dates, and from them you get Jupiter's positon for each ScW 
- you have precise positions of Jupiter. Then, query INTEGRAL's precise position at each ScW.
- finally, correct Jupiter's position for INTEGRAL's postion using Skycoord: calculate difference between cartesian vectors of Jupiter and integral
and then convert back to RA and DEC 

- take larger band, 15 to 60 keV (actually from 25 keV after like 2016 because of wear of the detector)
    - outgassing, semi-conductor wear (electrons get scattered on impurities and so more impurities due to irradiation means more scattering)
    - telescopes do annealing but dangerous
    - integral sensitivity diminsihed by a factor of 2 over the mission

To-do (priority):
[X] Fix ScW selection code (for now no precise RA and DEC)
[X] Crab:
    [X] Disable emails
    [X] Add upper bound for PPPP (for each revolution, look at max PPPP and take < max-10)
    [X] Change E range to 15 - 60 keV !!! WORSE !!!
    [X] When extracting variance, also extract variance in annular region around the source
    [X] When trying queries, append good scws
[X] Replicate the above for isgri_lc method 
[X] Replicate for Jupiter
[] Obtain long term LC using isgri_image
    [X] Crab
    [] Jupiter
[] Get weighted mean flux
    [X] Crab
    [] Jupiter
[] Obtain same LC using isgri_lc
    [] Crab
    [] Jupiter

Extras / following weeks:
[] Take into a count the parallax error by using INTEGRAL's ephemeride and Jupiter's position at each ScW
[] PSF fitting instead of extracting count rate from a single pixel (only fit amplitude, smeared gaussian for Jupiter)
    [X] Crab
    [] Jupiter
[] Monthly stacking
[] Code organisation: could define functions for querying and a utils script, would make everything cleaner

This is after I introduced good_isgri filtering AND pointings filtering (> first 5 and < last 10)!
The errors start happening at 2011-10, before it was working fine.
Since I managed to get data from 2003 to 2016 last time, the only thing I changed that could affect this is the energy range.

I try again with E from 15 to 30 keV like before.
    -> working fine up to 2009-08, then errors all the way 
    -> I waited for the run to finish, and in all ended up with [...] ScWs from 2003-02 to [...]

Try with 30 - 60 keV:
    -> 

Other:
- Disabling email not working, so I just removed token usage.
    - After upgrading api version it works
- Tested PSF fitting on Crab image: works good.
    - Fitting amplitude, position: looks okay, possibly too low count rate
    - Fitting amplitude, position and offset: better!
    - Fitting the variances and rotation angle changes nearly nothing
    - For smeared gaussian fitting, then it would be best to fit variances and theta (elliptical gaussian)

WEEK 7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To-do: 
[] Fix WCS problem for Jupiter ScWs
[] Re-run Crab + Jupiter querying and save all data to fits files (organize into folders)
    [X] Crab (images + light curves)
        -> images look exactly like light curves (when taking pixel values!)
    [X] Jupiter (images)
    [] Jupiter (light curves)
    [] Change plotting code to read from saved FITS files
[X] Redo the ScWs querying with astroquery: save the entire table and filter based on the table
    -> but not as many ScWs for Jupiter and none for Crab ...
[X] Annular count rate: take larger region
    -> took within annular region 20 < r < 40
[] Re-run queries for higher E range and for JEM-X
[] Stack images (see planets code on Volodymyr's GitHub) + plot distribution and check for excesses
[] Quantify data scientifically / statistically
[] Investigate OMC? Also account for parallax?
[] Refactor code with function definitions, etc.
