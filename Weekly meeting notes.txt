WEEK 1
Notes:
- INTEGRAL is in a highly elliptical orbit, spends most its time far from Earth => max observation time of ~ 2.5 days
- compare jupiter time scale variations (literature) to science windows (need to either split or combine the science windows)
- we will mostly be interested in images, not light curves (basically many images)
- main idea: find jupiter and science window(s) for certain timescale and stack images keeping Jupiter fixed.

To-do : 
[X] finish tutorial, especially part on science windows query 
[X] look at how to use tokens 
[ ] get Jupiter coordinates over time, find science windows that contain Jupiter using coordinates (search radius of roughly 50 degrees).
[ ] check literature for expected timescale variation of Jupiter X-ray emission
